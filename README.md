**Introduction**

This Power BI project delivers an interactive Global Customer Analysis designed to uncover meaningful insights from customer and sales data. The report transforms raw data into visually intuitive dashboards that help stakeholders monitor performance, understand customer behavior, and support data-driven decision-making across regions.

**Problem**

An international sales store is rapidly expanding its business across the globe and needs deeper insights into its performance. With operations spanning multiple countries, the organization faces challenges in identifying the most profitable regions, top-performing customers, and key revenue drivers.

Due to the scale and complexity of international operations, it is difficult for the business team to clearly understand which countries and customers contribute the most to sales and profit using traditional reporting methods.

**Things learnt from this Project**

I learned how to work with advanced DAX measures and time intelligence functions to compare sales and profit across different years. This project also helped me improve my skills in creating interactive dashboards using slicers and drill-down features, making it easier to analyze regional performance and identify top customers in a simple and clear way.

**Key insights from this Dashboard**

The United States is the most profitable country, followed by Germany and the UK. Sales performance shows a clear seasonal pattern, with the strongest sales occurring between October and March. In contrast, sales decline from April to September, indicating an opportunity to improve marketing strategies, pricing, or promotional activities during this period.

Product analysis reveals that Drinks, Cheese, and Desserts are the highest-selling categories, together contributing nearly half of the overall sales. To maximize future growth, the business should focus on promoting these high-performing products while maintaining effective pricing strategies in lower profit-generating countries such as Poland, Norway, Portugal, and Spain.
